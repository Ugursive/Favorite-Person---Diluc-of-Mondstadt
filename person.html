        <h2>Diluc's biografy</h2>

            Favonius</b>, Diluc is skilled in both combat and commerce.

            Diluc is the <b>son of the late Crepus Ragnvindr</b> and the adoptive brother of Favonius Knight Captain Kaeya

        <h2>Diluc's 
            ability</h2>
        <p>My one of favorite games - "Genshin Impact" has <b>Vision of god</b> - A Vision is a gift bestowed upon those who
            dwell in Teyvat and are recognized by the gods. They grant the user elemental abilities based on the element
            of their given Vision. It is said that those with Visions have a chance of ascending to Celestia and
            attaining godhood themselves. Diluc Ragnvindr has a pyro(fire) Vision and he use Two-handed weapon. Diluc
            Ragnvindr envelops his two-handed weapon in a bright flame, which he hits and burns his enemies.</p>
